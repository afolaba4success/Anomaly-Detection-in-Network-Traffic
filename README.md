# Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Traffic

Anomaly detection in network traffic is important in order to forestall possible attacks on the flow of the network, which could be in the form of denial of service, malware attacks and even loss of important financial and sensitive information.
### Aim of the Project 
The aim of this project is to train machine learning models that can detect anomalous behavior in network traffic. This model could be particularly useful in identifying potential security threats such as hacking attempts, malware infections, and other malicious activities.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the CICIDS2017 dataset.
**Description:**
This dataset was created by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecuirty at the University of New Brunswick. It consists of a 5-day data stream on a network created by computers using up-to-date operating systems.
The folder consists of 8 files consisting of cyber attacks such as Dos, DDos, Bot, PortScan, Hulk, GoldenEye, Heartbleed, etc.
